# NovelAutocompletor

NovelAutocompletor is a simple yet powerful text autocompletor and word prediction model inspired by classic literature.  
Trained on the timeless texts of "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll and "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley, this model leverages the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to generate and predict text in a style reminiscent of these literary masterpieces.

## Features  
1.   Simple and Lightweight: Built using TensorFlow, LiteraryPredict employs a straightforward LSTM-based architecture, making it easy to understand and extend.
2.  Classic Literature Training Data: The model is trained on "Alice in Wonderland" and "Frankenstein," providing a unique and whimsical text generation experience.
3.  Word Prediction: Given a sequence of words, the model predicts the next word in the style of the training texts.
4.  Text Autocompletion: Start typing a sentence, and LiteraryPredict will suggest completions based on the learned patterns from the classics.
